                        <p>Over my high school journey, and soon to come university journey, I've worked at a few places, which has given me some well rounded experience. My first and longest standing work experience would be with the OSA (Ontario Soccer Association) as a soccer referee. I've been refereeing with the OSA for nearly four years now, officiating over 500 games of various age groups. This has been a very rewarding experience as it has built my confidence, responsibility, leadership and teamwork skills.</p>

                        <p>My other job was a summer student job with Aeryon Labs Inc. During this job, I learned what it is like working a job in a high tech industry, working closely with some of the engineers, quality staff and managers in the company. Aeryon is a relatively small company still, so being in that closely knit community was very beneficial as I was able to communicate and socialize with all sectors of a business. Learning about the people and the work they do is truly a once in a lifetime experience for a high school student.</p>

                        <p>More detail on all these work experiences can be found on the work experience page, which can be found by clicking the button below.</p>

                        </header>

                        <p>I participate in various extracurricular activities like Electric Car Club and FedProv, which both help broaden my knowledge and understanding of how things work, both mechanically and politically. During my time with the Electric Car Club, I have learned a ton of things regarding the process of designing, building, testing and racing full size electric vehicles. Over my years, I've both designed a car from scratch, built a car from scratch, tested numerous cars, and in the most recent year raced the cars at the University of Waterloo 12V race.</p>

                        <p>At Fed Prov I was the Finance Deputy Minister for Ontario, in which we discussed some very serious topics with the other ministers of every province and the first nations people. We discussed topics regarding how we are allocating our money in the infrastructure and our plan to implement a universal income system over the next year. Both these topics I was quite on educated on prior to Fed Prov, but now understand at a much higher level.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, one of my most recent projects was this website, in which I started in early July, and continue to work on to date. This project was definitely one of my biggest accomplishments coding wise, and I am happy to see the project continue to grow and get better. This website uses a mixture of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, specifically JQuery. Alongside these programming languages, I also know Python and Java.</p>

                        <p>The two main sources for my volunteer hours, which has now passed 600 hours, is from peer tutoring at Bluevale Collegiate Institute and from facilitating the YMCA School Age Youth Development Program at our local elementary school, Lester B. Pearson public school. Both these programs require great communication skills with various age groups, and requires good responsibility, determination, leadership, teamwork and problem solving skills.</p>
