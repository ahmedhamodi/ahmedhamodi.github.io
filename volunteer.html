                            <h2>Peer Tutoring at Bluevale Collegiate Institute</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>At the peer tutoring club, I am among a handful of students who have been asked to assist in tutoring fellow students at Bluevale's Student Success classroom during lunches. Ahmed is an active leader and often requested by students to be their mentor through their struggles with various subject areas including Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, English, French, Geography, History and a few others. Ahmed has proven to be a well rounded student who can help in almost any subject that a student might be struggling in. Over the last few years, Ahmed has achieved an accumulative total of 196 hours from assisting in this program (As of July 31, 2016).</p>

                        <p>Tutoring is one of the most rewarding things that I do as I truly feel the pride of helping other people achieve milestones and new successes. I hear constant feedback from students that they got a good grade, or they are now passing a course they were previously failing. These students just need something there to help explain concepts a bit differently, and in a way that's easy to understand. Being a student myself, I understand the struggles they are going through, and often went through them myself. I am able to depict where they are having issues and advice them on where to start and focus on. I am able to lead these students to success, as long as they are willing to put the effort in.</p>

                        <p>I really enjoy helping students succeed, and this is something I'll continue to do as long as I can.</p>

                            <h2>School Age Youth Development Program at the Kitchener/Waterloo YMCA</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>At the SAYD program, I am among a group of three volunteers who assist in setting up, managing, and documenting activities and events done to help with the development of the youth who attend this program. We help involve the kids in the activities, push them our of their comfort zone to try new things, and expose them to new activities that they previously wouldn't have tried. We try to engage the kids in the activities, as well as the other kids to help build their individuality, their confidence, and their communicating skills. We end goal is to have the kids go back home every day and have another story to tell their parents at the dinner table.</p>

                        <p>However, a lot of the time is spent experimenting for the workers and volunteers, trying new activities and mind stretching puzzles and activities, and it's a hit or miss. Sometimes the kids don't seem too engaged or excited, sometimes they are really into it and hours fly by. That's why we document all the activities we do, and plan ahead for the upcoming week to try and build the best schedule for the kids, doing activities that previously worked in the past, while fitting in space for new ones.</p>

                        <p>On a daily level, we set up and take down any equipment used for each activity planned for the day, we manage and participate in the activities planned for the kids to help ensure safety and entertainment for them all. We clean and set up the snack station for the kids, and then clean and put back the food after snack is over.</p>

                        <p>In the end, our goal is to give the kids something to do after school is over, and I'm happy to be apart of this program in making kids days a little more exciting.</p>
